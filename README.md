# H1 Work Day Scheduler Challenge from Module 5

Requirements for this assignment were to create an app that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code had Moment.js which was used in this project.

The following were stepts taken to make this app:

1. Downloaded the starter code from the Module 5.
2. Added descriptions of each column in HTML to format each hour on the calendar.
3. Added styling to buttons in css to create colors for the work day scheduler columns.
4. Added functions in javascript for each time block for past present and future.
5. Added functions for saving content on the DOM.
6. Tested functions in Google Chrome many times to assure that they were working within the calendar app. Used Developer tools to test code in Chrome browser.
